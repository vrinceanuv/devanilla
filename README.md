# devanilla

We have created this library, because we know out there are lots of vanilla js in development apps, and we know that sometimes some helpers are welcomed.

devanilla purpose is to ease your way when you search for DOM elements or want to apply events to one or multiple elements, do Ajax calls, etc.

Below you can find a list of features and how you can use our library.

How to make it run to see it in action:
- npm install
- npm run babel
- npm run browserify
- npm start
- type in browser: http://localhost:9000/

What you need to use it in action:

What you need to make your own custom build:
