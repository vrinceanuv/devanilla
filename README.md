# devanilla

We have created this library, because we know out there are lots of vanilla js in development apps, and we know that sometimes some helpers are welcomed.

devanilla purpose is to ease your way when you search for DOM elements or want to apply events to one or multiple elements, do Ajax calls, etc.

It will be published soon as an npm package and you can install it as:
```
$ npm install devanilla
```

**Using it**
```
import devanilla from 'devanilla'
```
or
```
const devanilla = require('devanilla')
```

What you need to use it in action:
- browserify
- or
- require

What you need to make your own custom build:
`npm run babel`

PRs are welcomed when this will be released as version 1.

Features:
- coming soon -
